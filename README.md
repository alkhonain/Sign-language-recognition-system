# Sign-language-recognition-system
The main goal of this project is to design, implement and evaluate a model that can recognize sign language letters in real-time and give a direct translation. By creating this model we can improve the quality of life for people who are deaf by allowing other developers to implementing it through their applications and hardware devices they are working on. In return this can open up more room for improvement for the technology related to hearing impairment people.
